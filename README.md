# DSA521S-Phonebook-Algorithm
A simple phonebook application for a Namibian telecommunications company using basic linear data structures.
# Phonebook Algorithm - DSA521S Group Project

## Project Summary

This project is a phonebook application developed as part of the DSA521S Data Structures and Algorithms group assignment. The application supports basic operations such as **Insert**, **Search**, **Delete**, **Update**, and **Display** contacts, designed using simple linear data structures like arrays and linked lists.

The project aims to create an efficient phonebook algorithm for a Namibian telecommunications company.

## Features

1. **Insert Contact**: Adds a new contact to the phonebook.
2. **Search Contact**: Searches for a contact by name.
3. **Delete Contact**: Deletes a contact from the phonebook.
4. **Update Contact**: Updates an existing contact's phone number.
5. **Display Contacts**: Lists all contacts in the phonebook.
6. **Sort Contacts (Optional)**: Sorts contacts to optimize the search operation.
7. **Efficiency Analysis**: Analyzes the performance of the search algorithm.
